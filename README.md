# Parcel Easy Boilerplate

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/aarongarciah/parcel-easy-boilerplate.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Simple starter to start writing HTML, JS, and SCSS right away with no additional config. Can be used as a static site generator!

## Development

1. **Clone** or [download](https://github.com/aarongarciah/parcel-easy-boilerplate/archive/master.zip) this repository.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aarongarciah/parcel-easy-boilerplate.git
   ```

2. **Install** dependencies.

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run** dev mode. It will open a browser tab with the dev url [`http://localhost:1234/`](http://localhost:1234/).

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Production build

Run the build script and the optimized for production website will be generated in the `/dist` folder.

```
npm run build
```

## Serve production build locally

If you want to serve your production build (the generated `/dist` folder) locally just run this command and open [`http://localhost:5000/`](http://localhost:5000/) in your browser. This command runs the `npm run build` command before serving the `/dist` folder.

```
npm run serve
```
